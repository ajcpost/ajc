                    <ul>
                        <li>Password is sent over wire in clear and open to attack.</li>
                        <li>Password needs to be replicated in all services leading to operational overheads.</li>
                        <li>No provision for single sign-on.</li>

                    <h4>Password authentication - needs</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Mutual authentication; Clients must prove who they are and so must services.</li>
                        <li>Single sign-on.</li>
                        <li>Privacy, data should be viewable only by intended audience.</li>

                    <h3>What is Kerberos</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Is a trusted 3rd party authentication system (does not support authorization). </li>
                        <li> Is based on symmetric key encryption.</li>
                        <li> Example kerberized clients Login, ftp, smtp, imap, pop3 </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Ticket granting service</h3>
                    <p> Kerberos introduces a concept of a trusted 3rd party which maintains a centralized database of passwords for clients and services. The trusted authority forms the basis for supporting single sign-on and secure authentication for both clients and services. Any attack on the trusted service would compromise all the passwords and hence this should be kept secure, should ideally not host any other network service.</p>

                <section>
                    <h3>Authentication flow - meta ticket</h3>
                    <p>Client connects with the ticket granting service to authenticate. It sends its username, network address <strong>but no password</strong>. TGS validates network address, creates a "metaticket" which grants access to TGS, encrypts it with client's password and sends it back as a response. The metaticket acts as a gateway to obtain actual service tickets. It's reusable but valid for a fixed duration to reduce the possbility of attack.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Noone else apart from the requesting client can access the metaticket since it's encrypted with client's password.</li>
                        <li>Conversly, no malicious TG server can create a metaticket since it will not have client password.</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h3>Authentication flow - service access request</h3>
                    <p> To access a service, client uses the metaticket to request TGS for the actual service ticket. It sends its username, network address, service name, all encrypted with the TG key obtained as part of the metaticket. It gets back (a) real time secret, session encrypted with TG key (b) ticket for the service encrypted with server pw.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's not possible for any malicious TG server to respond since it doesn't have the TG key and can neither decrypt the client request nor can send any false response encrypted with the TG key.</li>
                        <li>The real time secret is created as a mechanism to prevent anyone from stealing the ticket and reusing it. This secret is shared for the session and gets known only to the real client and real service (by means of appropriate encryption).</li>
                    </ul>

                <section>
                    <h3>Authentication flow - service request</h3>
                    <p>Client uses the real time secret and encrypts an authenticator containing its name and network address. It sends this authenticator and the service ticket obtained earlier to the service. Service first decrypts its ticket and obtains the session key. It then decrypts the authenticator with this session key and verifies client information. It then encrypts an ACK with the session key and sends back as an response. Client receives the ACK, decrypts with the session key to verify.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It's not possible for a malicous service to send a valid ACK since it doesn't have the real time secret, session. </li>
                        <li> It's not possible for someone to just steal service ticket and use it because the service ticket must match the information in authenticator and for that session key is required.</li>
                    </ul>

                <h3>Loopholes</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Itâ€™s possible for someone to steal authenticator and service ticket together, fake as that client and use the service. Hence authenticator must be short-lived (actually should not be reusable). Chances of someone stealing it after the real request and resending in a short span are limited.</li>
                    <li>Time clocks must be synchronized.</li>
                </ul>
