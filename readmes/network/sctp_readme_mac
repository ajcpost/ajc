This SCTP kernel implementation is based on the same source code as the one
in the FreeBSD operating system.
It is just provided as a loadable network kernel extension.

The following files will be installed:
- SCTP.kext in /System/Library/Extensions
- libsctp.dylib in /usr/lib
- sctp.h and sctp_uio.h in /usr/include/netinet/

In addition the following files are replaced (they need some additional definitions):
- /usr/include/netinet/in.h
- /usr/include/sys/socket.h

To load the NKE you have to execute the following command with root privileges:

kextload /System/Library/Extensions/SCTP.kext

To unload the NKE you have to execute the following command with root privileges:

kextunload /System/Library/Extensions/SCTP.kext

Known limitations:
- You can not use connect() after listen() on 1-to-many
  style sockets.
- You can not use poll() for 1-to-many style sockets after listen().

If you find any bugs or problems, please let us know.

Happy SCTPing
