Usage
- mvn compile will only compile, will not create war/ear
- mvn install will create war/ear

POM structuring
- Parent POM defined repositories, properties, dependencies, plugins can be inherited by child pom.
- Parent POM need not do actual build but rather define individual modules (child poms) for the build.
- Adhere to standard Maven dir structure (workding_dir/src/main/). Maven is pretty picky about this.
- Don't use project.name, is a reserved tag?

Profiles
- Can be used to override various properties depending on the build environment (test, dev, 
  production).
  . e.g. Deployment path on Unix, Windows may be different.
  . e.g. Versions of libraries may be different for dev vs production.
- Activation tag can be used to activate a profile automatically if certain prerequisites are 
  met.

Plugins
