<p>As per IP specifications, every system on the internet is assigned a unique IP-based internet address which is 32 bit long. It consists of two parts : The first part identifies the network on which the host is present and is called as network-prefix. The second part indicates the host number of the host on the particular network and is called as host-number. This means that all the hosts on a particular network, will have the same network prefix, but a unique host-number. Similarly, two hosts from different networks will have different network-prefixes and may or may not have the same host-number.</p><p>Each organization has different kind of need for networks. Some require more number of networks (with lesser hosts in each network) and some require lesser networks (with huge number of hosts in each network). To cater to these varying needs, the address space was classified into three classes namely Class A, Class B and Class C. A small organization which needs less than 254 nodes per network, can reserve a network block from the Class C network. Similary, for organizations like HP, which requires thousands of nodes per network, a Class A network block would do the trick.</p><p>The classification is done based on the number of bits assigned to the network-prefix. Each class has a boundary based on how the network-prefix and the host-number is split within the 32-bit address.</p><p>Class A Networks </p><p>In Class A networks, the 32 bit address space is divided into two parts, the first 8 bits assigned to the network-prefix, followed by the 24 bit host-number. The highest order bit of the network-prefix <span style="font-weight: bold;">is always set to 0</span>.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>The first address 0.0.0.0 is reserved for default route and the last address 127.0.0.0 is reserved for loopback. This means, a maximum of (2^7-2) networks can be defined. Similarly, (2^24-2) hosts can be assigned per network. The first address is assigned for the network and the last address is assigned for the broadcast. </p><p> </p><p>Class B Networks </p><p>In Class B networks, the first 16 bits are reserved for the network-prefix, of which the two highest order bits will always contain 1-0, followed by a 14 bit network number. The remaining 16 bits are reserved for the host-number.</p><p><br></p><p>  </p><p> </p><p>So, in Class B networks, a maximum of 2^14 networks can be defined. Also, (2^16-2) hosts can be defined per network. </p><p> </p><p>Class C Networks </p><p>In Class C networks, the first 24 bits are reserved for the network-prefix, followed by an 8-bit host-number. The first three highest order bits of the network-prefix is always set to 1-1-0, followed by a 21 bit host number.</p><p><br></p><p>            0  3                                  23  24         31 </p><p>            ------------------------------------------------------- </p><p>           |110|                                     |            | </p><p>            ------------------------------------------------------- </p><p>                         Network Number                Host Number </p><p> </p><p>So, a maximum of 2^21 Class C networks can be formed and (2^8-2) hosts can be defined in each network.</p><p>There are no reserved addresses in Class B and Class C, because in the entire 32 bit address space, there will be only one default route. Also, 127.0.0.1 is always reserved as a loopback for any class of network. </p><p> </p><p><br></p><p>Subnetting</p><p><br></p><p>As the internet started growing (with tens of thousands of medium-size networks connected to it), it became evident that the address space (specially Class B) will be exhausted soon. It also meant more load on the routing tables, burden of administrators applying for ip address for every new network within the organization.</p><p><br></p><p>In order to overcome these problems, the concept of subnetting was introduced. It allows an organization to have multiple physical networks inside but share the same network address with the outside world. The host-number in this case is further divided as subnet-number and host-number. The networks within are distinguished using these subnet-number but it takes only a single route entry to reach all these sub-networks.</p><p><br></p><p>            0                                                    31</p><p>            -------------------------------------------------------</p><p>           |                               |        |              |</p><p>            -------------------------------------------------------</p><p>                         Network Number                Host Number</p><p><br></p><p>           |---------------Subnet Mask--------------|</p><p>Using the subnetting concept, the subnet structure of an organization is never visible outside the organization's private network. A single route from the internet to any subnet in the organization's intranet is enough, neverthless where the destination host is on. Since all subnets of a given network number use the same network-prefix, a route from the internet to any subnet of a given IP address is the same. This allows the organization's internal routers to differentiate between the different subnets. Also, this allows the local network administrator to manage the local intranet, without affecting the size of the internet routing tables.</p><p>Consider a organization like HP where there are several networks inside the organization. HP has a network number 15.0.0.0. The internet route accepts all the network packets addressed to 15.0.0.0 and HP's internal routers take care of forwarding them to different interior subnets. This is done based on the 2nd and 3rd field in the IP address. Finally, the packet will reach desired host, based on the 4th field which is the host number. So, if a packet belonging to 15.10.45.165 is sent from the internet, the internet route will sent it to 15.0.0.0 network. The routers with HP, will route it to the different subnets, based on the subnet mask. Normally, the subnet masks are calculated with a one-to-one correspondence with the network number. So, the subnet mask for 15.10.45.165 is 255.255.248.0. Based on this subnet-mask and the network address the packets are routed to different hosts within the subnet.</p><p><br></p><p>Finally, let's see the ANSWER to our main question ...</p><p>First, determine the binary equivalent of the IP Address 197.3.5.10. It is 11000101.00000011.00000101.00001010. The first three highest order bits contain 110, which indicates it is a Class C network.</p><p><br></p><p>Secondly, the requirement is for 12 subnets. We cannot have exactly 12 subnets, because subnets are created at the powers of two. So, either we can have 8(2^3) or 16(2^4) subnets. Since 8 subnets are not sufficients, we need to choose 16 subnets. 16(2^4), which means 4 bits are required to determine the 16 subnets in the alloted IP block.</p><p><br></p><p>In Class C networks, 24 bits are assigned for network-prefix and 8 bit for host-number. So, the first 4 bits of host-number is required to calculate the subnet mask.</p><p><br></p><p>Network Number 197.3.5.0        11000101.00000011.00000101.00000000</p><p><br></p><p>Subnet Mask    255.255.255.240  11111111.11111111.11111111.11110000 </p><p>                                                           ~~~~ </p><p>                                        4 bits taken from host-number </p><p>                                        to calculate subnet mask.</p><p>So, subnet mask is calculated by replacing all bits with 1's in the network-prefix and the no. of bits taken from host-number to form the desired number of subnets.</p><p>Based on this, the IP Address Range for the 16 subnets are :</p><p>197.3.5.0  - 197.3.5.16          11000101.00000011.00000101.00010000</p><p>197.3.5.17 - 197.3.5.32          11000101.00000011.00000101.00100000</p><p>197.3.5.33 - 197.3.5.48          11000101.00000011.00000101.00110000</p><p>.......................</p><p>.......................</p><p>197.3.5.208 - 197.3.5.224        11000101.00000011.00000101.11100000</p><p>197.3.5.225 - 197.3.5.240        11000101.00000011.00000101.11110000</p>
