        <span class="pagetitle">Wine Cellar History</span><br>
        <p>The Wine Cellar Restaurant is located at 50 University
          Avenue in Old Town Shopping Center. But long before the
          shopping center, the site was something else entirely - Los
          Gatos' first one-room schoolhouse, Los Gatos Central School,
          built in 1875 on what was then called School Street. In 1881,
          a second building was added, and in 1886 a new school was
          constructed at a cost of about $9000. The new school was
          closed down in 1909 and re-opened as the University Avenue
          School in 1923, styled after the Mission San Juan Capistrano,
          and served as the public grade school until 1961. *</p>
        <p>Many a patron have shared fond memories of their time
          here as students many years ago. When plans were made to
          change the school into a shopping center in 1966, the
          restaurant space was mainly excavated by hand from beneath
          what used to be the school's auditorium. The center had it's
          'heyday' in the seventies with many local artisans peddling
          their wares throughout the various shops‚Ä¶leather, pottery,
          jewelry, paintings, shoes, etc., and local talent performing
          in the Old Town Theater and the center's Outdoor Ampitheater.</p>
        <p>The Wine Cellar, then well known for it's live music,
          cheese fondue and wine selection, is one of Los Gatos' oldest
          restaurants and Old Town Center's only remaining original
          tenant!</p>
        <p>As you can imagine, after 30 years, the shopping center
          needed quite a facelift. From 1997 to 2001, Old Town had its
          transformation into the center you see today. The restaurant's
          floor plan had been altered a few times throughout the years
          but nothing as major as the renovation that coincided with Old
          Town's upgrade. If you have not been to the "new" Cellar, you
          will be amazed. We have carefully re-created the same
          intimate, cozy ambiance with a more upscale d√©cor of golden
          washed walls, custom iron work, a beautiful cherry and bird's
          eye maple bar and mica lighted booths. With the re-opening
          came the birth of our award-winning patio where you can enjoy
          scenic views of the beautiful Santa Cruz Mountains while
          sipping from your favorite wine or cocktail.</p>
        <p>The Hauck family has owned the restaurant since 1990 and
          just celebrated the Wine Cellar's 45th anniversary in 2011. We
          welcome you to our 'home" where every guest is treated with
          warmth and care and the meals are not only delicious, but
          hearty and fresh!</p>
        <p>We offer the freshest Seafood including Abalone, All
          Natural Painted Hills Beef, All Natural Chicken or Pork, Free
          Range Lamb, Pastas, and of course our famous Cheese and
          Chocolate Fondue. Come down for a Romantic Date, a Business
          Power Lunch or a celebration of any kind!</p>
